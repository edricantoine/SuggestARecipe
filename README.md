# MyFridge

An application that allows users to store a multitude of fridges,
each with their own list of ingredients. Items can be added to and 
removed from a fridge, and the Spoonacular API is used
to suggest recipes based on select items the user has 
in their fridge.

Powered by the Spoonacular API.
